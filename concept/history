At the turn of the 2nd millenia, Earth was on the brink of nuclear war. 

A small state developed nuclear weapons, world on edge of war, a failed assassination attempt leads to a nuclear launch, which leads to a retaliation. 

Aliens intervene.

Humans society is replaced by a reformation program, to integrate humanity into the unified galactic authority (UGA), to teach and train them to be better citizens.

Integration zones are setup at current major cities and hubs, the "ghettos" for humanity, though living conditions are reasonable but not luxurious.

Rural humans are mostly left alone. Several terrorist attacks by humans who believe they have been invaded and are occupied lead to several measures to greatly encourage human participation in reformation. The security forces of the UGA are made up of various races that have abilities that humans cannot successfully fight against in open battle.

Exploitative factions within the UGA gain favour to mine resources from Earth, and work independantly from the main authorities. Some work fairly while others exploit local workforces, but the majority of either work outside the jurisdiction of the UGA and hire private forces to maintain their operations.

Pockets of human tribes scatter the planet.

A group, known as "the Templars", dedicated to a human earth has recruited from within these human tribes to try and destabilise the alien "occupation" as they see it, as they believe Earth should be the property of the human race.
