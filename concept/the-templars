Initially small bands of humans protested against an alien invasion on both ethical and religious grounds. However they were also not entirely united and easily stopped. As time went on, a new underground movement, unified worldwide began to spread. Seeing these "aliens" come to exploit human lands, and with a deep rooted hatred/fear of aliens and alien technology, many conspiracies and theories led to the creation of the "The Templars".

This group has become very organised and their hidden leader or leaders, known only as the Prophet for his own protection, has become adept at executing guerrilla operations worldwide. Their benefactors are also somewhat mysterious, occasionally being found but always seemingly replaced.
