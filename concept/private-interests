Shortly after the UGA announced a stable Earth, private interests began bidding and taking over areas of the planet. This was advertised as being good for the earth as it would create an economy that would eventually be integrated with the galactic community, also giving humans jobs, benefits. 

The UGA greenlights the majority of those staking claims on the Earth, and ensures that humans are treated fairly, but shady practices leak through, as well as pirates and profiteers. Several humans have also ensured their practices and business survived first contact. Many resources are coveted, things that are abundant and occasionally overlooked by humans such as oxygen, water. 

Diamond and gold are used in the construction of starships, as well as other metals.
